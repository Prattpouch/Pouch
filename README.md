The Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University has developed a packaging method that extends the life of the NVP and AZT (or any other liquid formulation antiretroviral) by up to twelve months. The Pratt Pouch is a foilized, polyethylene pouch that resembles a fast-food ketchup pouch in appearance. Local pharmacist fill the pouch with the appropriate pediatric dosage under sanitary conditions and label them according to national guidelines. The filled pouches are distributed during antenatal care visits at district hospitals, clinics and on outreach trips to more rural communities by nurses and healthcare workers.

In 2015, the Pratt Pouch Project team decided to open source this technology, to encourage the widespread use of the pouch in not only delivering ARVs, but any health initiative that aims to further advance development in world healthcare technologies. 

Any work put forth by Prattpouch is licensed under the Pouch Open Hardware License.
